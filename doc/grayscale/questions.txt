questions for nVidia grayscale people (but TODO: look at their code
samples before sending this off):

- grayscale display works on Linux (Ubuntu 9.10, nVidia driver <TODO>)
  and Quadro FX 580 as well, with full 5 MP resolution. Colors
  converted to gray values look OK

  - why? Does that mean that pixel packing occurs and this
    configuration also works? Wouldn't the DVI cable otherwise be
    unable to transmit that resolution? Or is the refresh rate reduced
    accordingly?

  - if the refresh rate is reduced: wouldn't the grayscale
    reproduction still be accurate?

- (referring to
  http://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/40049/TB-04631-001_v02.pdf)

- is the unnormalized unsigned-int texture (internalFormat
  GL_ALPHA16UI_EXT) really necessary if you don't care about saving
  texture memory?

- why should it be necessary to download a new 1D LUT texture whenever
  the windowing contrast/level is changed? In our tests we just
  applied the windowing parameters to the grayscale texel values in
  the shader and then used the resulting windowed grayscale value for
  looking up the RGB triple in a single, non-changing LUT. With the 1D
  texture filter set to nearest-neighbor, interpolation between RGB
  values from the LUT is avoided, so the resulting RGB colors should
  be accurate.
